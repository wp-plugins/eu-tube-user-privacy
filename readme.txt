Enhances user privacy for embedded YouTube videos. 

== Description ==
This plugin enhances user privacy for embedded YouTube videos by serving videos from
the youtube-nocookie.com domain.

YouTube videos that are embedded in the editor by the standard `iframe` tag,
oEmbed, or short tag will be automatically converted to use the enhanced privacy
feature. YouTube videos that are embedded in widget areas using the `iframe` method
will also be converted to the nocookie version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Does this plugin work with custom fields?
If the Advanced Custom Fields plugin is active on the site, the plugin will also work
for the custom fields that have been added by that plugin. 

Can I limit sees the nocookie version of the video by country?
If you have the polylang plugin installed, you will be able to select which languages
and locales use the nocookie version of the YouTube embed code.
